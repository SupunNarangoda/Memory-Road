## Introduction

### Overview

**Memory Road** is a web-based, interactive board game designed to support people living with dementia and their caregivers through the therapeutic practice of reminiscence. The game combines gentle gameplay mechanics with historically accurate questions about Australian life from the 1940s to 1980s, creating a safe and encouraging environment for memory recall.

### Project Genesis

This project was born from personal experience with family members living with dementia. Observing how long-term memories remained vivid while short-term recall became challenging, I recognized an opportunity to create a digital tool that celebrates these preserved memories rather than highlighting what's been lost.

### Core Mission

Memory Road aims to:
- Provide a dignified, engaging activity for people with dementia
- Support caregivers with a customizable therapeutic tool
- Raise awareness about dementia in Australian communities
- Demonstrate the power of reminiscence therapy through interactive technology
- Create meaningful moments of connection between patients and their loved ones

### Target Audience

**Primary Users:**
- Adults aged 60+ living with early to moderate dementia
- Residents of Australian aged care facilities
- Elderly Australians receiving in-home care

**Secondary Users:**
- Family caregivers seeking engagement activities
- Professional caregivers in aged care settings
- Activity coordinators in dementia care facilities
- Dementia support groups and community organizations

## Game Theme Topic Justification

### The Dementia Crisis in Australia

Dementia is a critical health issue affecting Australian communities:

- **421,000+ Australians** currently live with dementia (Dementia Australia, 2023)
- **1.6 million Australians** are involved in their care
- Dementia is the **second leading cause of death** in Australia
- **Without a medical breakthrough**, the number is expected to increase to around 812,500 by 2054
- Dementia costs the Australian economy approximately **$15 billion annually**

These statistics represent real people - grandparents, parents, spouses, friends - whose lives and memories are profoundly affected.

### Why Reminiscence Therapy?

Reminiscence therapy is an evidence-based approach that involves discussing past activities, events, and experiences, usually with the aid of tangible prompts such as photographs, household items, music, or other familiar items from the past.

**Scientific Foundation:**
- Research published in the *International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry* shows reminiscence therapy can significantly improve quality of life for people with dementia
- Studies demonstrate reduced depression and anxiety symptoms
- Improved social interaction and communication
- Enhanced sense of identity and self-worth
- Stimulation of preserved long-term memories

**Why Long-Term Memories Persist:**
- In dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease, damage typically begins in the hippocampus (responsible for forming new memories)
- Long-term memories stored in the neocortex are often preserved longer
- Memories from ages 15-30 (the "reminiscence bump") are particularly resilient
- Emotional and sensory memories remain accessible longer than factual ones

### Australian Context

Memory Road focuses specifically on Australian historical and cultural experiences because:

1. **Cultural Relevance:** Memories are deeply tied to cultural context. Australian-specific content resonates more powerfully than generic questions.

2. **Shared Experience:** People aged 60+ share common Australian experiences:
   - The introduction of decimal currency in 1966
   - The moon landing watched on black and white TV
   - Home milk deliveries in glass bottles
   - The 1975 constitutional crisis
   - Pre-supermarket shopping from local bakers and greengrocers

3. **Identity Connection:** For Australians with dementia, these cultural touchstones provide anchors to their national and personal identity.

4. **Localized Care:** Most dementia resources are international; Australian-specific tools are limited but highly valuable.

### Why a Digital Game?

**Accessibility:**
- Free and available 24/7
- No physical materials to lose or damage
- Easily shared among family members and care facilities
- Updates and customization possible without reprinting

**Engagement:**
- Interactive elements maintain attention better than static materials
- Visual and audio stimulation (gentle animations, clear text)
- Immediate feedback provides satisfaction and closure

**Customization:**
- Digital format allows personalization impossible with physical games
- Family Admin Portal enables adding deeply personal questions
- Can be tailored to individual's background, region, and experiences

**Practicality for Caregivers:**
- Provides structured activity reducing caregiver burden
- Can be used independently or together
- Tracks engagement through score (though emphasis is on participation, not performance)

### Addressing the Gap

Current dementia resources often fall into two categories:
1. **Medical/Clinical:** Focus on diagnosis, treatment, medical management
2. **Generic Activities:** Puzzles, coloring books not specifically designed for dementia

**Memory Road fills the gap by being:**
- Specifically designed for dementia patients
- Therapeutically grounded in reminiscence therapy
- Culturally specific to Australia
- Both structured (game format) and flexible (customizable)
- Free and accessible
- Dignity-preserving with gentle, non-punitive feedback

### Personal Growth

This project taught me that meaningful impact doesn't require complexity or scale - it requires understanding, empathy, and execution. A simple web game, thoughtfully designed, can bring joy, connection, and cognitive stimulation to people who need it.

**Most Important Lesson:**
Technology is a tool for human flourishing. The measure of success isn't technical sophistication, but whether it makes someone's life better.

**Final Reflection:**
Creating Memory Road reminded me why I wanted to learn programming in the first place - to solve real problems for real people. When my grandmother plays this game and lights up remembering the milk cart coming down her street in 1955, that's worth more than any technical achievement.

This isn't just a project. It's a love letter to my grandparents, and to all the people whose memories deserve to be celebrated, not mourned.

## Conclusion

Memory Road represents the intersection of technology, healthcare, and human connection. It's a small contribution to a large challenge, but one made with care, research, and personal investment.

The journey of creating this game taught technical skills, design principles, and domain knowledge - but more importantly, it reinforced the value of building with purpose, empathy, and love.

As Australia's aging population grows and dementia cases increase, we need creative, accessible, dignified solutions. Memory Road is one small step in that direction.

The code is open-source. The approach is replicable. The impact is measurable.

But the real success will be measured in moments - moments of connection, of recognition, of joy when someone remembers their past and feels, for just a while, fully themselves again.

That's the road worth traveling.
