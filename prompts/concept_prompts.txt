PROMPT 1: Initial Concept Brainstorming
=========================================
```
Overview
For this challenge, students will vibe code using LLMs to design and develop a web-based game that highlights and addresses a pressing social challenge in Vietnam or Australia. The game should be fun to play, educational, and impactful - giving players a fresh perspective on important real-world issues.

Description
You are required to vibe code a game using any LLMs that you find suitable to achieve the goals. The aim is to deliver a complete web game that fits the theme:

The game should take the form of a board game, card game, dice game, or any game topic of simple web game format.
The gameplay mechanics must directly connect to the chosen social issue, making the game both educational and engaging.
Suggested themes may include (but are not limited to):
Climate change & sustainability
Access to education
Mental health & wellbeing
Social equity & inclusion
Community resilience
So on
Contestants need to decide on topics that suit their local context (either Vietnam or Australia).

Game Requirements
Your game must include at least the following screens/views:

Menu
Play
Please free to add other approriate screens as you would like.

Additional guidelines:

The game must be in 2D. (Optional: or 3D if your team is able.)
Game assets (sprites, backgrounds, sound effects, code logics, etc.) can also be generated using your choices of AI models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Nano Banana, Sora, …, where appropriate.
The game must only use HTML, CSS and Javascript. Feel free to use any HTML, CSS and JavaScript libraries/frameworks as long as it can run fully on the browser (only on front-end) without a need to install any additional installation or setup or backend.
You can use any AI platform, extension, website or service to help you to create this game.
Submission Requirements
Teams must submit following this specific directory structure on a public GitHub repository:

Note:

You need to submit the URL of the public GitHub repo via our Google form. Make sure the repo can be accessed easily without any constraints.
You need to follow the same directory structure and have the same folder names, file names, file extensions (in bold) as shown above.
Important: YouTube may take from a few minutes up to one hour to finish processing uploads (especially HD/4K). Upload your demo video early so the link is generated and fully playable before the deadline. Make sure the video is viewable (Public or Unlisted) without sign-in.
Submission

Please submit the full URL of your public GitHub repo containing game_submission folder (described above) to this form.
Make sure your team's name matches your registered team name.
Link: https://forms.office.com/r/1pLPWmYAdP
Reference Example Repository

To see the exact directory and file structure required for submissions, refer to this sample repo: https://github.com/TomHuynhSG/MyTeamName_Sample_Game_Project_Hackathon
Use it only as a reference for structure and naming; your game, assets, and prompts must be your own.
Assessment Criteria

Your game will be judged based on:

1. Relevance & Impact 
Assesses the game's connection to a significant social issue and its potential to raise awareness, foster empathy, or inspire positive action.

2. Creativity & Originality 
Evaluates innovativeness of game concept, gameplay mechanics, narrative, creative application of AI tools, and originality in addressing the social issue.

3. Gameplay & User Experience 
Assesses quality of player interaction, fun factor, engagement, visual design, controls, polish, and overall playability. You will be provided with game screenshots to visually evaluate the UI design, visual polish, layout, and overall aesthetic quality.

4. Technical Execution 
Evaluates code quality, structure, performance, best practices, and adherence to technical constraints (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, front-end only).

5. Documentation, Presentation & Reflection
Assesses quality and completeness of documentation (README, report, prompts), video presentation quality, and demonstration of learning/reflection.

Imagine you're a masterclass entrepreneur. 
Given these criteria above give 5 well thought out concept prompts for a game.

PROMPT 2: Game Mechanics Design
================================

```
**Goal:**
Build a fully playable 2D browser game called **“Memory Road”** using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (front-end only). The game must follow the hackathon requirements below.

**Hackathon requirements summary:**

* Theme: Social challenge relevant to **Australia** (focus on *dementia awareness & mental-health wellbeing*).
* Game type: A **board-game-style** experience (dice rolls, tiles, progression).
* Must include at least a **Menu screen** and **Play screen** (you may add Results, About, etc.).
* Runs entirely in browser; no backend.
* Directory structure must match the following:

  ```
  game_submission/
  ├── README.md
  ├── project_report.pdf
  ├── youtube_link.txt
  ├── prompts/
  │   ├── concept_prompts.txt
  │   ├── asset_generation_prompts.txt
  │   ├── code_generation_prompts.txt
  │   └── refinement_prompts.txt
  ├── game_app/
  │   ├── index.html
  │   ├── style.css
  │   ├── script.js
  │   └── assets/
  └── screenshots/
  ```

**Game concept:**
“Memory Road” is a gentle board game raising awareness of dementia.
Players roll dice to move along a life-path board of memories. Each tile triggers a mini-quiz about family, places, or emotions. Correct answers earn “memory points” that symbolize retaining memories; incorrect ones show empathy messages or dementia facts. The goal is to reach the end with the highest memory score, learning about dementia’s effects and coping strategies along the way.

**Technical details:**

* Use **vanilla JS or light libraries** (e.g., Canvas 2D API, p5.js, anime.js).
* Implement a **Menu → Play → Results** flow.
* Store player progress in `localStorage`.
* Add simple 2D sprites (player token, dice, background board).
* Include minimal sound effects and background music.
* Generate all assets (backgrounds, icons, etc.) with AI image prompts.
* Code should be clean, modular, and commented.

**Deliverables:**

1. A working front-end game in `/game_app`.
2. `README.md` with setup & play instructions.
3. `project_report.pdf` explaining theme, impact, mechanics, and tech stack.
4. AI prompts for concept, assets, code, and refinements (in `/prompts`).
5. Five screenshots in `/screenshots`.

**Now do the following:**

1. Generate the entire game folder structure.
2. Create `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` implementing the Menu and Play screens.
3. Implement core logic: dice roll, board movement, quiz popup, scoring, and results summary.
4. Use placeholder assets and text where needed.
5. Include comments in code indicating where AI-generated assets or prompts will go.
